# Product Requirements Document: LLM-Powered Todo List Application

## 1. Executive Summary

The LLM-Powered Todo List Application is an intelligent task management system that allows users to create, edit, and manage todo lists using natural language input. The application leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to parse free-form text into structured todo items and enables natural language editing of existing tasks.

## 2. Product Vision

Create a frictionless todo list experience where users can capture tasks and ideas in natural language without worrying about formatting, categorization, or structure. The LLM intelligently organizes and structures the information while maintaining the flexibility of traditional task management interfaces.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Natural Language Todo Creation

**Bulk Entry**: Users can enter entire todo lists in free-form text:
- "I need to buy milk, walk the dog, and finish the report by Friday"
- "Tomorrow: call dentist, pick up dry cleaning. This weekend: clean garage, organize photos"

**Incremental Addition**: Users can add individual items to existing lists:
- "Add buy milk to my list"
- "I also need to schedule the car service for next week"

**Intelligent Merging**: The system attempts to merge new items with existing similar items or categories, asking for clarification when uncertain.

### 3.2 Natural Language Editing

Users can modify existing todos using conversational commands:
- "Make the milk item high priority"
- "Move task ABC under task DEF"
- "Mark all grocery items as completed"
- "Move all high-priority grocery items to today and mark the low-priority ones as next week"

The LLM uses tools/functions to interact with the data model, acting as an intelligent agent.

### 3.3 Multiple Todo Lists

Users can maintain separate lists for different contexts:
- Work tasks
- Personal errands
- Shopping lists
- Project-specific todos

Each list maintains its own session history and context.

### 3.4 Global Search

**Type-ahead Search**: Users can quickly find any todo item across all lists using a search input field:
- Real-time search suggestions as user types
- Search results show the todo item and which list it belongs to
- Search across all todo fields (title, description, tags, categories)
- Quick navigation to the found item's location

### 3.5 Rich Data Model

Each todo item supports the following fields (all optional except title):
- **Title** (required)
- **Description/Notes**
- **Due Date**
- **Priority** (high, medium, low)
- **Completion Status**
- **Categories**
- **Tags**
- **Subtasks** (one level of nesting only)
- **Dependencies** (task A blocks task B)

### 3.6 Session History & Context Awareness

- **Persistent History**: All interactions with a todo list are stored as session history
- **Context Retention**: The LLM uses previous conversations to understand references and context
- **History Management**: Users can clear or compact (summarize) session history
- **Stateful Interactions**: Each list maintains context across multiple sessions

## 4. User Experience

### 4.1 CLI Interface Design

**Interactive Mode** (Primary Interface):
- Conversational chatbot-style interaction with LLM
- Natural language todo creation and editing
- Context-aware multi-turn conversations
- Default mode when running `todo-gpt` with no arguments
- Shows available lists with item counts on startup
- Auto-creates "Personal" list as default
- Current/default list system for seamless workflow
- LLM reasoning display (initially for debugging)

**Quick Commands** (Secondary Interface):
- One-off commands for power users: `todo-gpt add "buy milk"`
- Uses current list by default, can specify with `--list` flag
- Commands like `add`, `edit`, `list`, `search`, `set-current`
- Non-interactive mode for scripting and automation

**Future Commands**: Additional `/commands` in interactive mode will be added based on usage patterns and user feedback

### 4.2 Technology Stack

**Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
**CLI Framework**: commander.js for command parsing and structure
**LLM Provider**: OpenAI (with abstracted provider interface for future flexibility)
**Storage**: SQLite database stored in user home directory (configurable)
**Configuration**: Environment variables and config file support

### 4.3 LLM Intelligence Features

**Smart Parsing**:
- Date inference from phrases like "tomorrow", "next week", "Friday"
- Priority extraction from words like "urgent", "important", "whenever"
- Category detection from context clues
- Automatic tagging based on content

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Explains why operations can't be completed
- Suggests alternatives for impossible actions
- Prevents circular dependencies
- Validates hierarchical constraints

**Clarification Handling**:
- Asks for clarification when context is insufficient
- Uses existing list context to disambiguate references
- Learns from user corrections within session

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Data Structure

**Todo Item Schema**:
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string?",
  "dueDate": "date?",
  "priority": "high|medium|low?",
  "completed": "boolean",
  "categories": "string[]?",
  "tags": "string[]?",
  "subtasks": "TodoItem[]?",
  "dependencies": "string[]?",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

**List Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "todos": "TodoItem[]",
  "sessionHistory": "Interaction[]",
  "version": "number",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

### 5.2 LLM Integration

**JSON Schema Validation**: All LLM responses must conform to predefined schemas
**Tool/Function System**: LLM has access to tools for:
- Creating, reading, updating, deleting todos
- Batch operations
- List management
- Search and filtering
- Reordering and hierarchy management

**Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for different operations:
- Initial parsing prompts
- Editing command prompts
- Clarification prompts
- Tool usage prompts
